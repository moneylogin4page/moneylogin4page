Earnest also reviews your bank statements and debt obligations, and requires the following:

You do not carry large amounts of non-student, non-mortgage debt (e.g. credit cards, personal loans)
You have a history of making payments on time
You are not regularly charged late, overdraft, or insufficient funds fees

The requirements list is a bit lengthier than other student loan competitors, but this process helps Earnest lend to borrowers with lower credit scores. You can also apply with a co-signer that meets these requirements to help you get approval for a loan, but both parties must have no debts in collections and no history of bankruptcy on their credit reports.
